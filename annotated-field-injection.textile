h3. Injecting into Annotated Fields

p. This is where a component has an empty constructor with dependencies indicated by a field annotation and provided automatically by the container after instantiation.

{% highlight java %}
import javax.inject.Inject;

public class Apple { 
	@Inject private Orange orange; 
	@Inject private Pear pear; 
	@Inject private Banana banana; 
	// methods 
}
{% endhighlight %}

h4. Usage

{% highlight java %}
import com.picocontainer.MutablePicoContainer;
import com.picocontainer.DefaultPicoContainer;
import com.picocontainer.injectors.AnnotatedFieldInjection;

MutablePicoContainer pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new AnnotatedFieldInjection();
pico.addComponent(Apple.class); // etc 
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);
{% endhighlight %}

p. With an custom annotation instead of PicoContainer's @Inject

{% highlight java %}
import com.picocontainer.MutablePicoContainer;
import com.picocontainer.DefaultPicoContainer;
import com.picocontainer.injectors.AnnotatedFieldInjection;

MutablePicoContainer pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new AnnotatedFieldInjection(MyInjectAnnotaton.class);
pico.addComponent(Apple.class); // etc Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);
{% endhighlight %}

p. Yes that's right, there's no constructor needed. It means that for a Unit Test, you cannot simply 'new' the class without some magic to populate the dependency fields.

p. The component factory for this is a class "AnnotatedFieldInjection":/javadoc/core/com/picocontainer/injectors/AnnotatedFieldInjection.html . It only handles annotation-field injection for components.

p. Additionally the default component factory "AdaptingInjection":/javadoc/core/com/picocontainer/injectors/AdaptingInjection.html can also handle field annotation types, 
if the "@Inject":/javadoc/core/com/picocontainer/annotations/Inject.html annotation from PicoContainer's code-base is used as the marker for injection. AdaptingInjection will also fall through to constructor injection if there is no recognized @Inject annotation.
